# DELI-cious 🍞🥪

**DELI-cious** is a console-based Point-of-Sale (POS) application for a custom sandwich shop. Built as a capstone project, this system allows customers to fully customize their sandwich orders, including size, bread, premium/regular toppings, sides, and drinks.

## 📌 Project Overview

DELI-cious was designed to modernize the order process at a growing sandwich shop that previously handled all transactions using pen and paper. This application streamlines ordering, calculates totals, and generates time-stamped receipts—all while demonstrating Object-Oriented Analysis and Design principles.

## 🛠 Features

- Custom sandwich builder (size, bread, toppings, sauces, toasting)
- Add sides: drinks (multiple sizes/flavors) and chips
- Multiple sandwiches per order
- Price calculation (including premium toppings and extras)
- Order review and confirmation
- Receipt generation with timestamped filenames

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Language: Java (or specify your language)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O (for receipt generation)
- Console-based UI
- UML Design and Class Diagrams

## 📁 Folder Structure

- _Working on it_

## 📷 Screenshots
Coming soon: Include screenshots of each screen (Home, Add Sandwich, Checkout, etc.) once development progresses.

## ✅ Capstone Goals
- Practice OOP design and development
- Implement real-world problem solving in software
- Deliver a working console-based application
- Maintain source control with GitHub
- Track progress using GitHub Projects and Issues
